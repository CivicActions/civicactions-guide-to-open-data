# Principles

Open data principles from various sources.

## 8 Principles of Open Government Data

Government data shall be considered open if it is made public in a way that complies with the principles below:

### 1. Complete

All public data is made available. Public data is data that is not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations.

### 2. Primary

Data is as collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms.

### 3. Timely

Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.

### 4. Accessible

Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.

### 5. Machine processable

Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.

### 6. Non-discriminatory

Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration.

### 7. Non-proprietary

Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control.

### 8. License-free

Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret regulation. Reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions may be allowed.

## 7 Additional Principles

Here are some additional principles of open data that the working group did not consider but might have:

### Online & Free

Information is not meaningfully public if it is not available on the Internet at no charge, or at least no more than the marginal cost of reproduction. It should also be findable.

### Permanent

Data should be made available at a stable Internet location indefinitely and in a stable data format for as long as possible.

### Trusted

The Association of Computing Machinery’s [Recommendation on Open Government](http://www.acm.org/public-policy/open-government) \(February 2009\) stated, “Published content should be digitally signed or include attestation of publication/creation date, authenticity, and integrity.” Digital signatures help the public validate the source of the data they find so that they can trust that the data has not been modified since it was published. Since provenance is for originally-published documents, it is\_not\_a reason to prevent the public from modifying government documents.

### A Presumption of Openness

The presumption of openness rests on laws like the Freedom of Information Act, procedures including records management, and tools such as data catalogs.

Sunlight Foundation’s [Open Data Policy Guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/) state, “Setting the default to open means that the government and parties acting on its behalf will make public information available proactively and that they’ll put that information within reach of the public \(online\), with low to no barriers for its reuse and consumption. . . . Setting the default to open is about living up to the potential of our information, about looking at comprehensive information management, and making determinations that fall in the public interest.”

### Documented

Documentation about the format and meaning of data goes a long way to making the data useful.

The American Association of Law Libraries’s [Principles & Core Values Concerning Public Information on Government Websites](http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Advocacy/access/aeliccorevalues.pdf) \(March 24, 2007\) noted that it is as important for users to know the data is current as for the data itself to be current. Their principles state, “Government websites must provide users with sufficient information to make assessments about the accuracy and currency of legal information published on the website.”

### Safe to Open

The Association of Computing Machinery’s [Recommendation on Open Government](http://www.acm.org/public-policy/open-government) \(February 2009\) stated, “Government bodies publishing data online should always seek to publish using data formats that do not include executable content.” Executable content within documents poses a security risk to users of the data because the executable content may be malware \(viruses, worms, etc.\).

### Designed with Public Input

The public is in the best position to determine what information technologies will be best suited for the applications the public intends to create for itself. Public input is therefore crucial to disseminating information in such a way that it has value.

## International Open Data Charter

### **Principle 1**– Open by Default

1. We recognize that the term “government data” includes, but is not limited to, data held by national, regional, local, and city governments, international governmental bodies, and other types of institutions in the wider public sector. The term government data could also apply to data created for governments by external organizations, and data of significant benefit to the public that is held by external organizations and related to government programs and services \(e.g. data on extractives entities, data on transportation infrastructure, etc.\).

2. We recognize that free access to, and subsequent use of, government data is of significant value to society and the economy, and that government data should, therefore, be open by default.

3. We acknowledge the need to promote the global development and adoption of resources, standards, and policies for the creation, use, exchange, and harmonization of open data.

4. We recognize that open data can only be unlocked when citizens are confident that open data will not compromise their right to privacy, and that citizens have the right to influence the collection and use of their own personal data or of data generated as a result of their interactions with governments.

5. We will:

   a. Develop and adopt policies and practices to ensure that all government data is made open by default, as outlined in this Charter, while recognizing that there are legitimate reasons why some data cannot be released;

   b. Provide clear justifications as to why certain data cannot be released;

   c. Establish a culture of openness, not only through legislative and policy measures, but also with the help of training and awareness programs, tools, guidelines, and communication strategies designed to make government, civil society, and private sector representatives aware of the benefits of open data;

   d. Develop the leadership, management, oversight, performance incentives, and internal communication policies necessary to enable this transition to a culture of openness in all government departments and agencies, including official statistics organizations;

   e. Observe domestic laws and internationally recognized standards, in particular those pertaining to security, privacy, confidentiality, and intellectual property. Where relevant legislation or regulations do not exist or are out of date, they will be created and/or updated; and

   f. In accordance with privacy legislation and standards, anonymize data prior to its publication, ensuring that sensitive, personally-identifiable data is removed.

### Principle 2 – Timely and Comprehensive

1. We recognize that it may require time and human and technical resources to identify data for release or publication.

2. We recognize the importance of consulting with data users, including citizens, other governments, and civil society and private sector organizations to identify which data to prioritize for release and/or improvement.

3. We recognize that in order to be valuable to governments, citizens, and civil society and private sector organizations, data must be comprehensive, accurate, and of high quality.

4. We will:  
   a. Create, maintain, and share public, comprehensive lists of data holdings to support meaningful consultations around data prioritization, publication, and release dates;

   b. Release high-quality open data in a timely manner, without undue delay. Data will be comprehensive and accurate, and released in accordance with prioritization that is informed by consultations with open data users, including citizens, other governments, and civil society and private sector organizations;

   c. To the extent possible, release data in its original, unmodified form, and link data to any relevant guidance, documentation, visualizations, or analyses;

   d. To the extent possible, release data that is disaggregated to the lowest levels of administration, including disaggregation by gender, age, income, and other categories;

   e. Allow users to provide feedback, and continue to make revisions to ensure data quality is improved as necessary;

   f. Apply consistent information lifecycle management practices, and ensure historical copies of datasets are preserved, archived, and kept accessible as long as they retain value;

   g. Consult data users on significant changes to the structure or supply of data in order to minimize the impact to users that have created tools based on open data; and

   h. Be transparent about our own data collection, standards, and publishing processes by documenting these processes online.

### Principle 3 – Accessible and Usable

1. We recognize that opening up data enables governments, citizens, and civil society and private sector organizations to make better informed decisions.

2. We recognize that when open data is released, it should be easily discoverable and accessible, and made available without bureaucratic or administrative barriers, which can deter people from accessing the data.

3. We will:  
   a. Publish data on a central portal, so that open data is easily discoverable and accessible in one place;

   b. Release data in open formats to ensure that the data is available to the widest range of users to find, access, and use. In many cases, this will include providing data in multiple, standardized formats, so that it can be processed by computers and used by people;

   c. Release data free of charge, under an open and unrestrictive license;

   d. Release data without mandatory registration, allowing users to choose to download data without being required to identify themselves; and

   e. Ensure data can be accessed and used effectively by the widest range of users.  
   This may require the creation of initiatives to raise awareness of open data, promote data literacy, build capacity for effective use of open data, and ensure citizen, community, and civil society and private sector representatives have the tools and resources they need to effectively understand how public resources are used.

### Principle 4 – Comparable and Interoperable

1. We recognize that in order to be most effective and useful, data should be easy to compare within and between sectors, across geographic locations, and over time.

2. We recognize that data should be presented in structured and standardized formats to support interoperability, traceability, and effective reuse.

3. We will:  
   a. Implement consistent, open standards related to data formats, interoperability, structure, and common identifiers when collecting and publishing data;

   b. Ensure that open datasets include consistent core metadata and are made available in human- and machine-readable formats;

   c. Ensure that data is fully described, that all documentation accompanying data is written in clear, plain language, and that data users have sufficient information to understand the source, strengths, weaknesses, and analytical limitations of the data;

   d. Engage with domestic and international standards bodies and other standard setting initiatives to encourage increased interoperability between existing international standards, support the creation of common, global data standards where they do not already exist, and ensure that any new data standards we create are, to the greatest extent possible, interoperable with existing standards; and

   e. Map local standards and identifiers to emerging globally agreed standards and share the results publicly.

### Principle 5 – For Improved Governance and Citizen Engagement

1. We recognize that the release of open data strengthens the governance of and trust in our public institutions, reinforces governments’ obligation to respect the rule of law, and provides a transparent and accountable foundation to improve decision-making and enhance the provision of public services.

2. We recognize that open data encourages better development, implementation, and assessment of programs and policies to meet the needs of our citizens, and enables civic participation and better informed engagement between governments and citizens.

3. We recognize that engagement and consultation with citizens and civil society and private sector organizations can help governments understand which types of data are in high demand, and, in turn, can lead to improved data prioritization, release, and standardization practices.

4. We recognize that city or local governments are often the first point of interaction between citizens and government, and that these governments therefore have a crucial role in supporting citizen engagement on open data.

5. We will:  
   a. Implement oversight and review processes to report regularly to the public on the progress and impact of our open data initiatives;

   b. Ensure that information published as a result of transparency or anticorruption laws is released as open data;

   c. Provide training programs, tools, and guidelines designed to ensure government employees are capable of using open data effectively in policy development processes;

   d. Engage with the Freedom of Information / Access to Information / Right to Information community to align the proactive release of open data with governments’ obligation to release information on request;

   e. Engage proactively with citizens and civil society and private sector representatives to determine what data they need to effectively hold governments accountable;

   f. Respect citizens’ right to freedom of expression by protecting those who use open data to identify corruption or criticize governments; and

   g. Encourage the use of open data to develop innovative, evidence-based policy solutions that benefit all members of society, as well as empower marginalized communities.

### Principle 6 – For Inclusive Development and Innovation

1. We recognize the importance of openness in stimulating creativity and innovation. The more governments, citizens, and civil society and private sector organizations use open data, the greater the social and economic benefits that will be generated. This is true for government, commercial, and non-commercial uses.

2. We recognize that open data can help to identify social and economic challenges, and monitor and deliver sustainable development programs. Open data can also help meet global challenges such as poverty, hunger, climate change, and inequality.

3. We recognize that open data is, by its nature, an equitable resource that empowers all people by allowing them to access data regardless of who they are or where they live. However, we also recognize the existence of a global digital divide in regard to technological tools and expertise; this divide limits the ability of socially and economicallymarginalized people to access and use open data.

4. We recognize the role of governments in promoting innovation and sustainable development does not end with the release of open data. Governments must also play an active role in supporting the effective and innovative reuse of open data, and ensuring government employees, citizens, and civil society and private sector organizations have the data they need and the tools and resources to understand and use that data effectively.

5. We will:  
   a. Encourage citizens, civil society and private sector organizations, and multilateral institutions to open up data created and collected by them in order to move toward a richer open data ecosystem with multiple sources of open data;

   b. Create or explore potential partnerships between governments and with civil society and private sector organizations and multilateral institutions to support the release of open data and maximize the impact of data through effective use;

   c. Create or support programs and initiatives that foster the development or co-creation of datasets, visualizations, applications, and other tools based on open data;

   d. Engage with schools and post-secondary education institutions to support increased open data research and to incorporate data literacy into educational curricula;

   e. Conduct or support research on the social and economic impacts of open data;

   f. Build capacity and share technical expertise and experience with other governments and international organizations around the world, ensuring that everyone can reap the benefits of open data; and

   g. Empower a future generation of data innovators inside and outside government by building capacity and encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, civil society and private sector organizations, academics, media representatives, government employees, and other users to unlock the value of open data.

## Ten Principles for Opening Up Government Information

### **1. Completeness**

Datasets released by the government should be as complete as possible, reflecting the entirety of what is recorded about a particular subject. All raw information from a dataset should be released to the public, except to the extent necessary to comply with federal law regarding the release of personally identifiable information. Metadata that defines and explains the raw data should be included as well, along with formulas and explanations for how derived data was calculated. Doing so will permit users to understand the scope of information available and examine each data item at the greatest possible level of detail.

### **2. Primacy**

Datasets released by the government should be primary source data. This includes the original information collected by the government, details on how the data was collected and the original source documents recording the collection of the data. Public dissemination will allow users to verify that information was collected properly and recorded accurately.

### **3. Timeliness**

Datasets released by the government should be available to the public in a timely fashion. Whenever feasible, information collected by the government should be released as quickly as it is gathered and collected. Priority should be given to data whose utility is time sensitive. Real-time information updates would maximize the utility the public can obtain from this information.

### **4. Ease of Physical and Electronic Access**

Datasets released by the government should as accessible as possible, with accessibility defined as the ease with which information can be obtained, whether through physical or electronic means. Barriers to physical access include requirements to visit a particular office in person or requirements to comply with particular procedures \(such as completing forms or submitting FOIA requests\). Barriers to automated electronic access include making data accessible only via submitted forms or systems that require browser-oriented technologies \(e.g., Flash, Javascript, cookies or Java applets\). By contrast, providing an interface for users to download all of the information stored in a database at once \(known as “bulk” access\) and the means to make specific calls for data through an Application Programming Interface \(API\) make data much more readily accessible. \(An aspect of this is “findability,” which is the ability to easily locate and download content.\)

### **5. Machine readability**

Machines can handle certain kinds of inputs much better than others. For example, handwritten notes on paper are very difficult for machines to process. Scanning text via Optical Character Recognition \(OCR\) results in many matching and formatting errors. Information shared in the widely-used PDF format, for example, is very difficult for machines to parse. Thus, information should be stored in widely-used file formats that easily lend themselves to machine processing. \(When other factors necessitate the use of difficult-to-parse formats, data should also be available in machine-friendly formats.\) These files should be accompanied by documentation related to the format and how to use it in relation to the data.

### **6. Non-discrimination**

“Non-discrimination” refers to who can access data and how they must do so. Barriers to use of data can include registration or membership requirements. Another barrier is the uses of “walled garden,” which is when only some applications are allowed access to data. At its broadest, non-discriminatory access to data means that any person can access the data at any time without having to identify him/herself or provide any justification for doing so.

### **7. Commonly owned or open Standards**

Commonly owned or open standards refer to who owns the format in which data is stored. For example, if only one company manufactures the program that can read a file where data is stored, access to that information is dependent upon use of the company’s processing program. Sometimes that program is unavailable to the public at any cost, or is available, but for a fee. For example, Microsoft Excel is a fairly commonly-used spreadsheet program which costs money to use. Freely available alternative formats often exist by which stored data can be accessed without the need for a software license. Removing this cost makes the data available to a wider pool of potential users.

### **8. Licensing**

The imposition of “Terms of Service,” attribution requirements, restrictions on dissemination and so on acts as barriers to public use of data. Maximal openness includes clearly labeling public information as a work of the government and available without restrictions on use as part of the public domain.

### **9. Permanence**

The capability of finding information over time is referred to as permanence. Information released by the government online should be sticky: It should be available online in archives in perpetuity. Often times, information is updated, changed or removed without any indication that an alteration has been made. Or, it is made available as a stream of data, but not archived anywhere. For best use by the public, information made available online should remain online, with appropriate version-tracking and archiving over time.

### **10. Usage Costs**

One of the greatest barriers to access to ostensibly publicly-available information is the cost imposed on the public for access–even when the cost is_de minimus_. Governments use a number of bases for charging the public for access to their own documents: the costs of creating the information; a cost-recovery basis \(cost to produce the information divided by the expected number of purchasers\); the cost to retrieve information; a per page or per inquiry cost; processing cost; the cost of duplication etc.

Most government information is collected for governmental purposes, and the existence of user fees has little to no effect on whether the government gathers the data in the first place. Imposing fees for access skews the pool of who is willing \(or able\) to access information. It also may preclude transformative uses of the data that in turn generates business growth and tax revenues.
