# Glossary

## Accountability

Ensuring the public \(including civil society and private sector organizations, academic and media representatives, and citizens\) has the data and information needed to hold the government to account for its policy and service delivery performance. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/)_\)_

## Accurate

Data that is accurate is correct, and reflects the most current information available at the time of publication. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/)_\)_

## Analytical limitations

Conditions or qualities of data that may require additional attention from users prior to using that data or drawing conclusions from it._ \(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Anonymize 

Processing data that includes personal information so that individuals can no longer be identified in the resulting data. This is related to the concept of de-identification, the process of conducting an analysis of the risk of personal identification based on available data, and either encrypting or removing such personal data from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Anticorruption 

Laws, policies, and practices designed to prevent, detect, investigate, or eradicate the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Common forms of corruption include bribery, collusion, and embezzlement. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Applications

A self-contained program or piece of software designed to fulfill a particular purpose \(an application\). _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Build capacity

Supporting or developing the skills, knowledge, tools, and experience necessary for individuals and organizations to meet particular goals, particularly in the context of developing countries. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Civic participation

Also known as civic engagement, civic participation is the process of citizens and organizations actively participating in the public sphere, including, for example, social participation \(e.g. volunteering or donating funds\) and political participation \(e.g. voting or communicating with representatives\). _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Civil society

An organization, group, initiative, or network may qualify as being a member of civil society if it meets any of the following criteria:

● it works on a charitable or not-for-profit basis

● it is a non-government organization, academic institution, or expert network

● it is a corporation that engages in philanthropic investment in support of open data and sustainable development

The term “civil society” is the aggregate of all organizations meeting any of the criteria above. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Co-creation

The collaborative development of datasets, or collaborative reuse of existing open datasets to develop applications, programs, and other tools, as well as graphs, infographics, and other visualizations. Usually the result of collaboration between governments and citizens, private sector, and/or civil society organizations. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Comparable

Data that is comparable should be easy to compare over time and across organizations. For example, contracting data for multiple government ministries should be generated using the same data standards to ensure the data can be compared across ministries \(e.g. all ministries use a standardized date format to indicate the time period of all contracts, or record contract awardees using standardized names or identifiers\). _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Comprehensive 

Data that is comprehensive is both complete and detailed, without significant gaps or missing data elements. Likewise, datasets should include all data relevant to their description. For example, a dataset recording all contracts awarded by a particular ministry would be comprehensive if it is not missing any data points \(e.g. no dates or amounts are missing\) and it is reflective of all relevant contracts \(e.g. all contracts under $25,000 awarded by that ministry, not just a sampling of contracts\). _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Core metadata

Metadata is the data providing information about one or more aspects of data within a dataset. It is used to summarize basic information about data, which can make it easier to track and work with specific data. Core metadata is a limited set of metadata which provides important, fundamental information about data, and should be defined by a consistent vocabulary across all datasets. Core metadata elements may include the dataset title, source, publication date, and format, as well as other relevant information that describes the dataset and supports discoverability \(that is, makes it easier to search for and find the dataset\). For further information on core metadata, see the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative \(DCMI\) Metadata Terms or the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary \(DCAT\). _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Data ecosystem

The complex system of relationships between individuals, organizations, datasets, standards, resources, platforms, and other elements that define the environment in which each particular data resource exists. A data ecosystem may include “multiple data communities, types of data, institutions, laws and policy frameworks, and innovative technologies and tools.” _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Data literacy 

The skills and knowledge required to access, read, understand, and manipulate data. This may include knowledge of data usage software and visualization techniques. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Data users

Any individual or organization that accesses, downloads, or republishes data, or who uses data to develop apps, visualizations, reports, and other information products or services. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Digital divide

“The gap between individuals, households, businesses and geographic areas at different socio-economic levels with regard to both their opportunities to access information and communication technologies \(ICTs\) and to their use of the Internet for a wide variety of activities.” _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Disaggregated 

Disaggregated data is data that is broken down or separated into component parts. Data can, for example, be disaggregated by age, allowing users to view relevant data broken down by ages or age categories. Statistical data may be disaggregated prior to publication to allow users to easily group data based on categories like age, gender, or region. When data is presented in the most disaggregated way, and as it was directly collected from the source without any further processing, then it is usually referred as raw data or primary data. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Discoverable

Data that is discoverable can be easily found and accessed by users, including online and through search engines. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Domestic and international standards bodies

Groups, networks, or organizations that focus on the creation, development, revision, and/or implementation of data standards at a local, state, national, regional, or international level. These standards bodies may include, but are not limited to, the ISO, W3C, IETF, etc. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Equitable resource

A resource that is, by its nature, available to anyone, regardless of their social or economic status. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Evidence-based policy making

The set of processes or methods which advocates a more rational, rigorous and systematic approach to the creation of policy. Evidence-based policy making seeks to inform the policy process, rather than aiming to directly affect the eventual goals of the policy. The pursuit of evidence-based policy making is based on the premise that policy development and decision-making should be better informed by available evidence and should include rational analysis._\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Freedom of expression 

Right to express one's ideas and opinions freely through speech, writing, and other forms of communication but without deliberately causing harm to others' character and/or reputation by false or misleading statements. Freedom of press is part of freedom of expression. Freedom of expression includes the right to criticize government policies, practices, laws, and programs without fear of retribution, unlawful detention, or violence._\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Freedom of Information / Access to Information / Right to Information community

## Global data revolution 

The ongoing, global movement that has resulted from “an explosion in the volume of data, the speed with which data are produced, the number of producers of data, the dissemination of data, and the range of things on which there is data, coming from new technologies such as mobile phones and the ‘internet of things’, and from other sources, such as qualitative data, citizen-generated data and perceptions data” coupled with “a growing demand for data from all parts of society”. This movement is the sum of dozens of national, regional and global formal initiatives to foster the use of data._\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Globally agreed standards 

Data standards which have been adopted or endorsed by a large number of governments or organizations, and which are recognized as contributing significantly to the improvement or standardization of high-value data. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Governance 

Processes of management, oversight, or decision-making which impact a particular project or program. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Human-readable formats 

As defined in the Open Data Handbook, “Data in a format that can be conveniently read by a human. Some human-readable formats, such as PDF, are not machine-readable as they are not structured data.” _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Information lifecycle management practices

Information lifecycle management practices are any practices or policies related to the creation, retention, archiving, or disposition of data or information. These practices may include the length of time data and information resources are retained, and how and when they are archived to ensure future access to them. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## International governmental bodies

An organization, group, or network that acts as a quasi-governmental body at the international level. Examples include the United Nations. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Interoperable 

Interoperability is the ability to work with other products or systems, present or future. In order to be interoperable, data should follow established international data standards to ensure that it is interoperable across a number of different systems or analytic products. Interoperable data can be easily compared over time, across locations, and within and between organizations, as well as being easily manipulated to produce visualizations and identify trends. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Machine-readable formats 

As defined by the Open Definition, machine-readable formats are those data formats which are readily processable by a computer where the individual elements of the \[data\] can be easily accessed and modified. The Open Data Handbook defines machine-readable data as “Data in a data format that can be automatically read and processed by a computer.” _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Mapping standards

A comparison between standards at a domestic \(local, state, national\) level and an international \(regional, global\) level, used to identify similarities and gaps between different data standards. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Multilateral institution 

An organization, group, or network made up of governments or government representatives. These institutions may be regional or global. Examples include the OECD or the G20. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Open and unrestrictive licence

Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose, subject, at most, to requirements that identify the data’s provenance and preserve openness. Licenses should be published and linked to open data to ensure data users can easily find and understand the conditions of data access and reuse. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Open by default 

“Open by default” policies mandate that data or information should be open and available for the public to find, access, and use under an open and unrestrictive license, unless there is a specific, pressing reason why that data or information cannot be made open, and that reason is clearly communicated to the public. Currently, most governments operate by asking whether there is any pressing, important reason why a data or information resource should be open \(e.g. overwhelming public demand, legal requirement\). Under an “open by default” policy, governments would instead operate by assuming that all data and information should be open, and asking whether there is any important, pressing reason why data or information cannot be made open \(e.g. security or privacy considerations\) In cases where data cannot be made open, it may instead be closed data \(which can be accessed only by the data subject, owner, or holder\) or shared data \(which is accessible beyond its subject, owner, or holder, but is only accessible to a limited group of people or organizations\). _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Open standards 

Data standards which are publicly available and developed, refined, and/or maintained through a collaborative, transparent decision-making process. Open standards are published under an open license, are thoroughly documented, and are made publicly available at zero or low cost, so that they can be accessed and used by anyone. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Personal data \(or personally-identifiable data\)

Any data that, when used alone or in combination with other available data, may identify an individual. While most personal data cannot be open for reasons of privacy and confidentiality, personal data may be closed, or shared with specific people or organisations. In some cases, personal data may be licensed as open data. This would include, for example, data concerning the identity, contact information, or expense claims of government officials or legislators. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Private sector 

Any non-governmental organization, group, or network that works to generate profit. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Rule of law 

The principle that all individuals, organizations, and institutions are subject to and accountable under clear, publicized law that is fairly applied and enforced. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Socially and economically marginalized people

People who, as a result of their culture, ethnicity, gender, religion, or social or economic status are limited in the influence of power they can exert in the public sphere, and particularly as it relates to civic participation. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Source 

The point of origin of data, which may be the originally published dataset \(in the case of republished or reused data\) or the individual or organizational author of the data \(in the case of originally published datasets\). _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Standardized format 

Standardized formats may include both file formats and data formats. A standardized file format should be machine-readable, and used consistently across projects or organizations or over time. Examples include CSV, JSON, or XML formats. A standardized data format is a guideline or series of guidelines that defines the way in which data should be collected or recorded, supporting comparability and interoperability between datasets. Examples include the General Transit Feed Specification \(GTFS\), or the International Aid Transparency Initiative \(IATI\) Standard. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Structured 

Data that is organized according to a fixed schema, and is often incorporated in a relational database. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Sustainable development 

“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it \[...\] the concept of needs, in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and the \[concept\] of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.” _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Traceability 

Traceable data is data that can be “followed” across datasets. For example, international development aid funding may be traced by linking the funds to a unique project identifier in all datasets referring to the funds \(e.g. the awarding government’s disclosures, the local recipient’s reporting, and the service deliverer’s contract\); starting from any of these datasets, a user may trace the funds to the other datasets thanks to that unique project identifier. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Transparency 

Ensuring the public \(including civil society and private sector organizations, academic and media representatives, and citizens\) has the data and information needed to understand the workings of their government. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_

## Visualization 

Any visual representation of data other than a dataset. Visualizations may include, but are not limited to, plots, tables, graphs, or infographics. _\(Source: _[_Open Data Charter_](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dkan/dkan-guide-to-open-data/edit#)_\)_
